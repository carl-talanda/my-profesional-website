			<p>Hello i'm Carl Jaybert Talanda i'm An Front End Developer i can Absolutely Code an very good project and designs complex,fancy animations with scratch no css framworks, i can code that really meets your needs :). And i'm Confidience at Coding, i been learned coding since 2022 but quit because my all grades passed on school but in grade 9 it was slowly learn coding but still had chance to pass so quited coding but in grade 10 things gets even more serious i deeply learn coding and ditched video games disciplined myself
			and i'm a self taught Front End developer I also learned data science,machine learning courses basics that i learned how to create ai but for no i ditched learning to be ai scientist because my spec is too limited so i gotta head first to front end development no giving up no matter what how hard is it, and my future is ai scientist coz i'm interested at creating AI i have my own ai created from scratch only had 50 parameters cannot reach more 50 parameters my pc could get crashed. even cloud to train large model ai wont work on me because my internet is so slow. so i made my own and tweaked an setup on this 20$ pc tweaking setup to achive profesional front end development setup as possible. well tested it can present zoom without lags on my intel core duo e7400 tm,geforce 9400 gt with nouveau... im probably a very bad student at school im very sorry because grades are power more powerful than my project my parent said</p>
